# Discovering the ETSCTF file under the webroot of cnfpss/10.0.40.193

## Steps I did for capturing the flag:

- First, I used Nmap utility for discovering a web service on **cnfpss/10.0.40.193**, for 100 points.

- Then, I used the cURL command for extracting the HTML content of the website into my laptop, and be able to analyze the code better with Visual Studio Code.

- Finally, after reading the code, I discovered the ETSCTF file under the webroot, for other 100 points!
