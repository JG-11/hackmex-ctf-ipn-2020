# Discovering the HTML source code ETSCTF flag of http://10.0.50.147/index.php

## Steps I did for capturing the flag:

- First, I used Nmap utility for discovering a web service on **foobarzoo/10.0.50.147**, for 100 points.

- Then, I used the cURL command for extracting the HTML content of the website into my laptop, and be able to analyze the code better with Visual Studio Code.

- Finally, after reading the code, I found the keyword: ETSCTF. I just copied and pasted the hidden flag into the contest dashboard and I got the other 100 points!
